# Devconnector
Online course learning to apply the MERN stack

Devconnector is a social media app built using the MERN stack with react and redux on implemented on the front-end. It also uses an express server with bcrypt and JWT tokens for authorization with passport upon login on the backend.

The aim for this course is to familiarize myself with MongoDB, redux, JWT tokens and passport as it was briefly taught in the web-dev bootcamp but wasn't implemented in my final project.

Expected date of completion: Jun 22, 2018.
